LuckyUI is Waveful's official design system. It provides accessible, themeable
components, design tokens, and tooling to build scalable, high‑quality
interfaces.

### What's included

- **Design tokens**: colors (palette, semantic roles, dark mode), spacing, radii,
  shadows, borders, z-index, transitions, and breakpoints.
- **Typography**: fonts (Geist family by default), sizes, weights, letter spacing,
  line heights, and text styles for headings, body, and code.
- **Components**: accessible React components built with Tailwind CSS—buttons,
  inputs, forms, dialogs, toasts, navigation, data display, and primitives.
- **Theming**: light/dark modes, brand theming via CSS variables, and token-driven
  customization for product surfaces.
- **Accessibility**: keyboard interactions, ARIA attributes, and focus management
  integrated by default.
- **Tooling**: docs site, Storybook playground, code mods, and CLI helpers to
  bootstrap new apps or consume tokens in design tools.

> Goal: a single source of truth for Waveful's UI—cohesive, accessible, and fast to ship.

## LuckyUI for Flutter

LuckyUI is also available for Flutter development, providing the same design system principles and components for mobile and desktop applications.
